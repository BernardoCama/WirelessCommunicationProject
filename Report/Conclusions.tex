\subsection{What we have learned}

With this project, we have understood the potentials of different beamforming techniques.\\
We have used beamforming for isolating a source in an enviroment full of interference and for tracking users,
and these two are the main field in which beamforming is used. 

\subsection{Our difficulties}

The core of the project was the implementation of the beamformers and the design of the system for the communication 
between the user(s) and the base station.\\
The main problem we have found was finding the way of implementing digitally the physical formulas and check the physical meaning 
of the results we have obtained.

\subsection{Future developments}

With the new generation of cellular systems, massive MIMO is becoming more and more important.\\ 
With the availability of such a huge number of antennas (for sure, more than 16x16 arrays, which are the biggest we 
have used), beamforming becomes more precise, thus allowing a better localization of sources.
